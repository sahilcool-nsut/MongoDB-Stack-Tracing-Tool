# Eu-Stack Analyzer

This is a tool to provide individual stack reports, particularly aimed for analyzing Running MongoDB servers.

It sets up a flask server which prompts to upload the necessary files, which are
 - **Single iteration of eu-stack**
 > Sample Command
 > sudo eu-stack -p PID > stack>txt
 - **Single iteration of top command**
 > Sample Command
 > top -H -bn1 | grep "conn" > topH.txt
 > H

It uses the combination of a **single iteration of eu-stack** and **top** command to provide insights and analysis using different graphs, by rendering a HTML page. This is done using a **python** script.
